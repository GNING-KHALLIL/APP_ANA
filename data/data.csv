The decline of mangroves calls for action to rapidly and accurately monitor them. Remote Sensing makes it possible to remotely monitor mangroves from images captured from space. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are examples of remote sensing satellites and there is extensive research on their land cover mapping capabilities, including mangrove mapping. While machine learning is a popular methodology for mangrove mapping (e.g., the use of Random Forest) there exist simpler techniques, i.e., utilizing threshold segmentation-based indices that only use a formula and a specific threshold to extract mangrove extents from satellite imagery (mostly Sentinel imagery). This study compared the products and the accuracy of different threshold segmentation-based mangrove mapping indices in four study areas in the Philippines and one in Indonesia. Results showed that the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI), Automatic Mangrove Map and Index (AMMI), and the Optical and SAR images Combined Mangrove Index (OSCMI) subindex SWIRB (full name of this subindex here) were the superior indices with overall accuracies (OA) greater than 80% in all study areas and reaching a maximum of 90%, 91% and 96%, respectively. By McNemar's test showed that their results have insignificant differences. MVI, SWIRB, and AMMI only used Sentinel-2 optical imagery, which means the addition of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery was unnecessary. Since the validation data is a product of machine-learning classification, this shows that using threshold segmentation-based indices is promising as it is simpler, faster, and requires little skill compared to using classification techniques.",mangrove index,néant,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",conference,"Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2",Mangrove index; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1; Google Earth Engine; Mangrove Extent,COMPONENTS; FOREST,non lu,

However, these methods usually require a substantial level of manual processing for each image. Hence, conservation practitioners prioritize using cloud computing platforms to obtain accurate canopy classifications of large extensions of mangrove forests. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution and rate of change (area gain and loss) of the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and other dominant mangrove species, mainly Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa, between 2015 and 2020 throughout the northwestern coast of Mexico. Bimonthly data of the Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) from all available Sentinel-2 data were processed with the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The results indicated an extension of 42865 ha of red mangrove and 139602 ha of other dominant mangrove species in the Gulf of California and the Pacific northwestern coast of Mexico for 2020. The mangrove extension experienced a notable decline of 1817 ha from 2015 to 2020, largely attributed to the expansion of aquaculture ponds and the destructive effects of hurricanes. Considering the two mangrove classes, the overall classification accuracies were 90% and 92% for the 2015 and 2020 maps, respectively. The advantages of the method compared to supervised classifications and traditional vegetation indices are discussed, as are the disadvantages concerning the spatial resolution and the minimum detection area.

However, the absence of an operational multi-feature fusion approach and an ensemble classification system restricts the achievement of this goal. This study aims to develop an object-oriented multi-feature ensemble classification scheme (OMEC). First, an enhanced mangrove spectral index (EMSI) is established by analyzing the spectral reflectance differences between mangrove forests and other land cover types. Sentinel-2 images are segmented into objects using the multi-resolution segmentation method. Then, spectral, textural, and geometric features are extracted, and these features (including EMSI) are inputted into the nearest neighbor classifier to implement mangrove classification. The experiment was conducted in three typical mangrove areas in China using Sentinle-2 images. The results demonstrate that EMSI exhibits good spectral separability for mangroves and performs well in the ensemble classification scheme. The overall accuracy of mangrove classification exceeds 90%, with a Kappa coefficient greater than 0.88. The object-oriented multi-feature ensemble classification scheme significantly improves accuracy and exhibits excellent performance. The method enhances the accuracy of mangrove classification, enriches the approach to mangrove remote sensing interpretation, and offers data support and scientific references for the restoration, management, and protection of coastal wetlands.",an enhanced mangrove spectral index,Q1,Frontiers,journal,Sentinel-2,Sentinel-2 images; an enhanced mangrove spectral index; multi-features; object-oriented segmentation; spectral reflectance signature,INDEX; CONSERVATION; CHINA,non lu,

However, the previous vegetation indices used for extracting the spatial distribution of mangroves were not able to effectively extract submerged mangroves, and the applicability of the vegetation indices used on different spatial resolution images obtained from different sensors was not verified. In this study, a new vegetation index, namely the intertidal mangrove identification indices (IMIIs), was proposed, based on GF-2 images of high and low tide levels. Meanwhile, other commonly used vegetation indices were also extracted. All the vegetation indices were used to extract the spatial distribution of mangroves under tidal inundation, and applicability tests of the vegetation indices were conducted on Sentinel-2 images in three different regions. It was found that the IMIIs proposed based on GF-2 images of high and low tide levels can extract submerged mangroves relatively well, and the spatial distribution extraction results of mangroves are better than those of other vegetation indices, with IMII2 outperforming IMII1. At the same time, IMIIs have good applicability in medium resolution Sentinel-2 images, and there are relatively large differences in the extraction results of mangrove spatial distribution among different vegetation indices in areas with significant impact of tidal inundation. Among all vegetation indices, the extraction results of IMIIs are relatively superior. In most cases, multi variables collaborative application can improve the accuracy of mangrove spatial distribution extraction results. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that the IMIIs proposed in this study can accurately extract the spatial distribution of mangroves inundated by tides from both medium- and high-resolution images, providing accurate basic data for effective management and scientific protection of mangrove resources.",mangrove extraction,Q1,MDPI (Forests),journal,"Sentinel-2, Gaofen-2",mangrove extraction; vegetation indexes; Gaofen-2 images; intertidal mangrove identification index; Sentinel-2 images,FORESTS; INDEX; DISCRIMINATION; ECOSYSTEMS; SATELLITE,non lu,mangrove mapping based on tidal inundation images

In this context, studying mangrove cover and dynamics could provide valuable insights to enhance coastal area management.Methods This study introduces an innovative framework that assesses mangrove extent and coastal vulnerability by integrating the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI) with the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model to accurately identify areas of highest priority for intervention. Using MVI applied to Landsat-8 (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (2023, resampled from 10 m to 30 m) imagery, we mapped mangrove cover for 2013 and 2023, refining accuracy by excluding pixels beyond 1.2 km inland and above 10 m elevation. A cloud-based workflow leveraging Google Earth Engine and QGIS enabled scalable, efficient analysis.Results The mangrove area declined from 2,116 km2 in 2013 to 1,739 km2 in 2023-a 18% loss, equivalent to 1.8% annually. The results of the Coastal Vulnerability Model, applied to the entire coast of Mozambique, produced an Exposure Index (EI) for flooding and erosion events. Each point along the coast was classified with values from 1 to 5 at a distance of 100 m from each other: the highest values indicating greater exposure. It emerged that 16.2% of the 11,768.11 km of coastline were classified with an EI as 'Very Low', 42% as 'Low', 32% as 'Intermediate', 9.4% as 'High' and 0.1% as 'Very High'. Considering the points classified with a 'High' and 'Very High' EI, approximately 1,117.97 km of coastline is highly vulnerable and in need of intervention. Analysis of the impact of Cyclone Idai (2018-2019) on the P & uacute;ngu & egrave; and Buzi River delta revealed a 69% reduction in mangrove cover, from 76 km2 to 23 km2.Discussion These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions, prioritizing Sofala and Zambezia for mangrove restoration and nature-based solutions to bolster coastal resilience.

Although a few attempts have been reported, effective methods that can repeatedly generate large-scale mangrove maps on a timely basis are still lacking due to the difficulty in gathering sufficient training samples in large geographical areas. In this study, we have addressed three objectives in the following manner: (1) we aim to develop a method to automatically collect ample mangrove training samples; Corre-spondingly, we developed an automatic training sample collection method which extracted unchanged mangrove samples from a historical mangrove map; In addition, we employed a region growing method to include more diversified training samples; (2) we strive to foster compatible classifiers that can leverage the collected one-class training samples; To this end, we came up with two representative one-class classifiers: the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), and the Positive and Unlabeled Learning algorithm (PUL); (3) we endeavor to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of training samples, classifiers, and input images; As a result, we developed 32 classification models by varying four different variables: training samples (unchanged vs. expanded), input data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2), classifiers (SVDD vs. PUL), and study sites (Florida, the United States and Guangxi, China). We found that our developed automatic training sample collection methods performed well (user's accuracy >97%). Inter-annual NDVI combined with geometric restrictions warranted the effective extraction of unchanged training samples while the region growing method further reduced the omission due to its addition of recently emerged mangroves. In addition, PUL performed better than SVDD. This is attributed to the fact that PUL draws upon not only mangrove samples, but also unlabeled ones unaccounted for in SVDD. Lastly, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 is recommended among all the compared models. In sum-mary, we developed an effective method to automatically extract mangrove training samples, based on which a one-class classification method for large-scale mangrove mapping is made possible. We envision our methods will contribute to a wide spectrum of timely large-scale mangrove mapping tasks.",mangrove mapping,Q1,Elsevier (Remote Sensing of Environment),journal,"Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat",Large-scale mapping; Mangrove forests; Training sample collection; One-class classification; Region growing; Remote sensing; Landsat; Sentinel; Google Earth Engine,ONE-CLASS CLASSIFICATION; DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; FORESTS; COVER; CHINA; ENHANCE; BIOMASS; WORLDS; NDWI; MAP,non lu,

To this end, a prototype change mangrove loss alert system has been developed to identify mangrove losses on a monthly basis. Implemented on the Microsoft Planetary Computer, the Global Mangrove Watch v3.0 mangrove baseline extent map for 2018 was refined and used to define the mangrove extent mask under which potential losses would be identified. The study period was from 2018 to 2022 due to the availability of Sentinel-2 imagery used for the study. The mangrove loss alert system is based on optimised normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds used to identify mangrove losses and a temporal scoring system to filter false positives. The mangrove loss alert system was found to have an estimated overall accuracy of 92.1%, with the alert commission and omission estimated to be 10.4% and 20.6%, respectively. Africa was selected for the mangrove loss alert system prototype, where significant losses were identified in the study period, with 90% of the mangrove loss alerts identified in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mozambique and Guinea. The primary drivers of these losses ranged from economic activities that dominated West Africa and Northern East Africa (mainly agricultural conversion and infrastructure development) to climatic in Southern East Africa (primarily storm frequency and intensity). The production of the monthly mangrove loss alerts for Africa will be continued as part of the wider Global Mangrove Watch project, and the spatial coverage is expected to be expanded to other regions over the coming months and years. The mangrove loss alerts will be published on the Global Mangrove Watch online portal and updated monthly.",change detection,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,mangroves; deforestation; mangrove loss; global mangrove watch; change detection; near real time; mangrove loss alerts; early warning; Sentinel-2; Africa,FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION; EROSION,non lu,

Therefore, reliable, accurate, and timely mangrove information is essential for conservation, protection, and sustainable management. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided an opportunity to observe and monitor mangroves spatially and temporally. Remote sensing technology could detect and acquire information like mangrove extent, cover change, species composition, canopy density, mangrove biomass, and carbon sequestration. In this study, European satellite Sentinel-2 data was used to map the defoliation of mangroves of Dharamtar creek, India, caused by the insect 'teak defoliator' (Hyblaea puera). Defoliation from the study area was recorded from August 2019 to October 2019. Mangrove plant Avicennia marina is the most dominant species distributed across the forest, and it was the only species observed to be infested. The total area of mangroves of Dharamtar creek was estimated to be 8175.5 ha. Out of the total mangrove area, high defoliated, moderately defoliated, low defoliated and very low defoliated and un-defoliated mangrove areas were estimated as 6.6%, 9.9%, 8.3%, 50.17% and 25.0%, respectively. The infestation was affected more than 6,000 hectares of mangroves. Unhealthy and stressed mangroves due to defoliation caused by the infestation of H. puera were detected using NDVI in the study area. The details regarding the moth, infestation of mangroves, its causes, impacts and other related information was discussed. We recommend further studies to investigate the causes of outbreaks, preference of this insect to this particular species of mangroves over other species and other implications of defoliation.

This study estimates the extent and afforestation potential of mangroves along the Egyptian Red Sea coast from 1984 to 2022 using NDVI derived from Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2 data in Google Earth Engine. Aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), carbon (C) stock, and CO2 sequestration potential were evaluated using Sentinel-2 and elevation data. Future afforestation suitability (2020-2050) under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios was assessed with the MaxEnt model. Mangrove area increased from 0.95 km2 in 1984 to 1.46 km2 in 2022, with Landsat-5 classification accuracy between 89 and 94 % and Sentinel-2 at 92-96 %. Mean AGB and BGB were 63.48 Mg/ha and 18.41 Mg/ha, while mean C stock and CO2 sequestration were 40.94 Mg/ha and 150.25 Mg/ha, respectively, below global averages. Under SSP2-4.5, 18.60 km2 and 21.40 km2 were identified as highly and moderately suitable for afforestation, decreasing to 12.34 km2 and 12.50 km2 under SSP5-8.5. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, high-suitability areas for mangroves would be predominantly located along the northern coast, with fewer areas identified along the southern coast. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, high-suitability areas are expected to shift and concentrate only in the northern regions. Significant predictors under SSP2-4.5 included sea water velocity, bathymetry, and air temperature, while SSP5-8.5 highlighted bathymetry, sea surface temperature, and salinity. This study provides insights into mangrove dynamics, biomass potential, and afforestation opportunities, offering critical guidance for conservation and restoration strategies.",monitoring mangrove,Q1,Environmental and Sustainability Indicators,journal,Sentinel-2,Carbon stock; Mangroves; MaxEnt model; NDVI; Species distribution,CARBON STOCKS; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; FORESTS; HEIGHT; GULF; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES,non lu,

Out of 64 global mangrove species, 11 are endangered. In Maharashtra, mangroves are concentrated around Mumbai, with an estimated 54.5 square kilometers in Thane Creek, where Avicennia marina shows signs of infestation. This current research used Sentinel-2 data from 2018 to 2022 to assess defoliation caused by Hyblaea puera, the teak defoliator. Ground-truth observations from 2020 to 2022 confirmed the extent of defoliation and identified varying infestation levels categorized as very highly infested, highly infested, moderately infested, low infested, very low infested, and uninfested. NDVI analysis examined these levels in relation to meteorological factors such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The analysis revealed an extended peak infestation both spatially and temporally, along with severe defoliation during the study period. Six categorical infestation hotspots were identified and compared with meteorological parameters, revealing that Hyblaea outbreaks were more common during low wind speeds and moderate temperatures, with peak infestations occurring after heavy rainfall and under moderate relative humidity.

The Blue Carbon Explorer, a Google Earth Engine app, was launched in 2023 to identify areas for mangrove protection and restoration. The tool allows users to visualize and inspect changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of mangrove habitats over various temporal and spatial scales using Norway's International Climate & Forests Initiative PlanetScope mosaics (Planet-NICFI), Sentinel-2 images, and Landsat archive composites, as a proxy for habitat condition, indicative of active photosynthesis. Users can also explore lidar and radar-derived canopy height data, analyze changes in mangrove area and extent using the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI), calculate areas of significant change based on NDVI, and prioritize mangrove areas for restoration based on their likelihood to recover naturally. Previous mangrove restoration efforts in the Caribbean have largely been based on enhancing coastal protection benefits, as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) for climate adaptation. The Blue Carbon Explorer (BCE) provides governments and conservation practitioners with an easy-to-use decision support tool for tracking changes in mangroves and identifying priority areas for conservation and restoration aimed at ecological recovery and enhancing carbon storage.

We analyzed 36 years (1987-2022) of Landsat data to map long-term changes in mangrove extent and stand types, alongside low-tide Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI composites to reduce tidal influence on spectral and backscatter signals. A systematic sampling design incorporating 257 field plots and hierarchical clustering was used to identify six distinct species communities. Tidal inundation had a significant impact on backscatter and reflectance, highlighting the importance of low-tide imagery for accurate species discrimination.

Within this increase, rehabilitated and regenerated areas added 837 and 681 ha, respectively. However, the rehabilitated stands were largely monoculture and structurally less complex, signaling the need for more diverse and ecologically informed restoration strategies.

Some studies resorted to remote sensing for constructing mangrove indices (MIs). However, there are still some drawbacks in existing MIs. On the one hand, difficulty still persists in distinguishing mangroves from nonmangrove vegetation and nonvegetated areas at the same time. On the other hand, the existing MIs have not fully utilized the phenological trajectories, which can greatly help to distinguish mangroves from other land covers. To overcome these issues, we built a novel mangrove index, namely generalized composite mangrove index (GCMI) by compositing vegetation indices (VIs) and water indices (WIs) based on Sentinel-2 time series data. Firstly, to determine the optimal indices, a similarity trend distance (ST distance) measure was proposed based on Pearson correlation coefficient and dynamic time warping (DTW). Secondly, in order to optimize the weights of selected indices, a population reconstruction genetic algorithm (PRGA) was designed. Finally, mangroves were mapped by feeding the time series of GCMI into random forest classifier. Experiments conducted over three areas along the southern coast of China demonstrate that: 1) GCMI enhances the separability between mangroves and other land covers compared to the existing VIs, WIs, and MIs, with an averaged overall accuracy of 91.45%; 2) ST distance outperforms Euclidean distance, Cosine distance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and DTW in optimizing the weights of GCMI; 3) PRGA greatly improves the probability of attaining global optimal result. The innovation lies in the presented GCMI considering both the vegetation trajectory information and water inundation using time series.",vegetation mapping,Q1,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,journal,Sentinel-2,Indexes; Vegetation mapping; Time series analysis; Feature extraction; Remote sensing; Sea measurements; Tides; Generalized composite mangrove index (GCMI); mangrove mapping; random forest (RF); remote sensing,LEAF-AREA INDEX; FORESTS; DISCRIMINATION; CHINA,lu,

This study proposes a new index, the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI), to rapidly and accurately map mangroves extent from remotely-sensed imageries. The MVI utilizes three Sentinel-2 bands green, Near Infrared (NIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) in the form vertical bar NIR-Green vertical bar/vertical bar SWIR-Green vertical bar to discriminate the distinct greenness and moisture of mangroves from terrestrial vegetation and other land cover. Spectral band analysis shows that the vertical bar NIR-Green vertical bar part of MVI captures the differences of greenness between mangrove forests and terrestrial vegetation. The vertical bar SWIR-Green vertical bar part of the index expresses the distinct moisture of mangroves without the need for additional intertidal data and water indices. The MVI value increases with the increasing probability of a pixel being classified as mangroves. Eleven mangrove forests in the Philippines and one mangrove park in Japan were then mapped using MVI. Accuracy assessment was done using field inventory data and high-resolution drone orthophotos. MVI have successfully separated the mangroves from other cover especially terrestrial vegetation, with an overall index accuracy of 92%. The MVI was applied to Landsat 8 images using the equivalent bands to test the universality of the index. Comparable MVI mangrove maps were produced between Sentinel-2 and Landsat images, with an optimal minimum threshold of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. MVI can effectively highlight the greenness and moisture information in mangroves as reflected by its moderate to high correlation value (r = 0.63 and 0.84, alpha = 0.05) with the Sentinel-derived chlorophyll-a (C-a) and canopy water (C-w) biophysical products. This study developed and implemented two automated platforms: an offline IDL-based 'MVI Mapper' and an online Google Earth Engine-based MVI mapping interface. The MVI implemented in Google Earth Engine was used in generating the latest mangrove extent map of the Philippines. Additionally, the application of MVI were tested to four additional mangrove forests in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia; and to selected mangroves forests in South America, Africa and Australia.",mangrove extent,Q1,Elsevier (ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,Mangrove index; Mangrove extent; Sentinel-2; Landsat; Vegetation mapping; Philippines,HYPERSPECTRAL DATA; FOREST TYPES; LANDSAT; CONSERVATION; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION; REFLECTANCE; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; REGION,lu,

Accurate mapping of mangrove forests is a great challenge for remote sensing because mangroves are periodically submerged by tidal floods. Traditionally, multi-tides images were needed to remove the influence of water; however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain local tidal conditions. Therefore, extracting mangrove forests from a single-tide imagery is of great importance. In this study, reflectance of red-edge bands in Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to establish a new vegetation index that is sensitive to submerged mangrove forests. Specifically, red and short-wave near infrared bands were used to build a linear baseline; the average reflectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline is defined as the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI). To evaluate MFI, capabilities of detecting mangrove forests were quantitatively assessed between MFI and four widely used vegetation indices (VIs). Additionally, the practical roles of MFI were validated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally. Results showed that: (1) theoretically, Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have the largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs. In addition, the boxplot showed that all submerged mangrove forests could be separated from the water background in the MFI image. Furthermore, in the MFI image, to separate mangrove forests and water, the threshold is a constant that is equal to zero. (2) Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99-102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted by MFI. Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations, the MFI offers great benefits in accurately mapping mangrove forests as well as other coastal and aquatic vegetation worldwide.",vegetation indexes,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI); red-edge band; aquatic vegetation; tidal condition; vegetation index; coastal vegetation,DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; AQUATIC VEGETATION; TAIHU LAKE; LANDSAT; CHINA; TREE; RED; CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEMS,lu,

Nevertheless, threats to mangroves from climate change and human activities are rising. This study examined how different plant growth phases respond to climate fluctuations using medium-resolution remote sensing data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) via satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat)-derived vegetation indices. Five vegetation indices for two main mangrove species found in Iran: Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata were evaluated during a 30-year span from 1993 to 2023. Based on this research, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI) are the most appropriate indices for capturing the distinct phenological responses of individual mangrove species. Using NDVI, the start, end, and peak of the growing season for both species, occur in September, May, and January, respectively; however, there are small differences in peak days for different species. The time-series data analysis showed that throughout the past three decades, the growing season length (spanning from September to May) has decreased approximately by 1-2 days for both species, However, the patterns differed between species: A. marina's growing season advanced by 6-7 days (both start and end), while R. mucronata's was delayed by 1-2 days. The decline in growth length and changes in the start and end of growing season are attributed to altered precipitation patterns including changes in the timing (start and end), intensity and total amount of rainfall and high temperatures. Our results show that growth cessation during the hottest months coincides with periods when daily maximum temperatures exceed 29 degrees C, as reported by regional climate data. The results of the GAM analysis revealed distinct climatic sensitivities across species, with R. mucronata showing a stronger response to minimum temperature and precipitation than A. marina. The research emphasizes the significance of vegetation index selection for accurate monitoring of the impact of climatic variations on mangrove species considering different periods (growing season, non-growing season, spring, summer, fall, and winter). Furthermore, this study revealed the effectiveness of using multi-spectral medium resolution satellite imagery for assessing individual tree species phenology and highlighted the crucial necessity for focused conservation initiatives to reduce the impacts of climate change and protect important coastal habitats, particularly regarding the influence of climate change on mangrove ecosystems in semi-arid areas.",mangrove species,Q1,Elsevier (Ecological indicators),journal,"Sentinel-2, Landsat",Mangrove species; Phenological parameters; Climatic change; Vegetation indices; Google earth engine,LAND-SURFACE PHENOLOGY; VEGETATION PHENOLOGY; SPATIAL-PATTERN; TIME; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT; INDEX; VARIABILITY; RESPONSES; RAINFALL,lu,

Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle.

This study aimed at evaluating the spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove forest variations for three ecological zones of the Can Gio biosphere reserve (i.e., core, buffer, and transition zones) and its relation to land use/land cover changes. Time series Sentinel-2 Imagery-which presents the Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained through the Google Earth Engine and Overlap Similarity Algorithm-was used to characterize vegetation cover in the study area. Furthermore, the Cohen's Kappa agreement was applied to examine the accuracy of mangrove classification, and the Mann-Kendal (MK) significance was used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of mangrove forests. The results showed that an NDVI value greater than 0.3 recorded the reflected signal of mangrove population in the study area with anO-index greater than 0.85.

However, more frequent and increasingly powerful hurricanes and storm surges are creating additional pressure on the natural resilience of these threatened coastal ecosystems. Advances in remote sensing techniques and approaches are critical to providing robust quantitative monitoring of post-storm mangrove forest recovery to better prioritize the often-limited resources available for the restoration of these storm-damaged habitats. Here, we build on previously utilized spatial and temporal ranges of European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel satellite imagery to monitor and map the recovery of the mangrove forests of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) since the occurrence of back-to-back category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, on September 6 and 19 of 2017, respectively. Pre- to post-storm changes in coastal mangrove forest health were assessed annually using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and moisture stress index (MSI) from 2016 to 2023 using Google Earth Engine. Results reveal a steady trajectory towards forest health recovery on many of the Territory's islands since the storms' impacts in 2017. However, some mangrove patches are slower to recover, such as those on the islands of Virgin Gorda and Jost Van Dyke, and, in some cases, have shown a continued decline (e.g., Prickly Pear Island). Our work also uses a linear ANCOVA model to assess a variety of geospatial, environmental, and anthropogenic drivers for mangrove recovery as a function of NDVI pre-storm and post-storm conditions. The model suggests that roughly 58% of the variability in the 7-year difference (2016 to 2023) in NDVI may be related by a positive linear relationship with the variable of population within 0.5 km and a negative linear relationship with the variables of northwest aspect vs. southwest aspect, island size, temperature, and slope.",vegetation index,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,mangrove recovery; forest health; hurricanes Irma and Maria; google earth engine; sentinel satellite imagery; NDVI; MSI,VEGETATION INDEX; SEA-LEVEL; ECOSYSTEMS; ELEVATION; IMPACTS; HEIGHT; FISH,lu,

Despite their ecological value, these ecosystems are often underestimated globally. Remote sensing (RS) techniques are widely used for large-scale monitoring of mangroves worldwide. This study aims to map mangrove relicts (Rhizophora mangle L.) in the Transboundary San Pedro River Basin (TSPRB), which spans Mexico and Guatemala, using RS and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Field surveys were conducted to collect 419 ground points, distributed across the control (274 points) and verification (145 points), ensuring accurate classification of mangrove areas. To evaluate the performance of mangrove forest classification, we used composite images created from the red (B2), green (B3), blue (B4), and near-infrared (NIR) bands, along with the Normalized Difference Mangrove Index (NDMI). For this purpose, we applied the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method, which effectively combines spectral information from composite images to achieve precise mangrove detection. The land cover classification was performed using Sentinel-2 from 2023 and the NDMI, achieving an accuracy of 80% and a Kappa Index of 0.73. The results show 2130.69 ha of mangroves along the San Pedro River. It includes 1868.38 ha in Mexico and 262.31 ha in Guatemala.

However, few studies of the hurricane impact have taken into consideration the legacy of past climate events and analyzed the heterogeneity of hurricane impacts between montane forests and coastal mangroves. Here, we studied the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 on coastal mangroves and upland forests in Puerto Rico after a severe drought during 2015-2016. We investigated the island-wide immediate impact on greenness using fused vegetation index from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, and the impact on and the recovery of 62 homogeneous vegetation patches by deriving an impact index and one-year recovery ratio (RR). A linear mixed-effect model was applied to explore roles of hurricane wind, rainfall, topography, and biological components in the impact and the recovery. Island-wide, the immediate impact is highly spatial-heterogeneous. Although most of the island was browned, a green-up strip in the dry south showed benefits from the hurricane rain which relieved the prior drought stress. Coastal mangroves experienced the greatest impact and slowest recovery with relative recovery of 0.44 compared to recovery greater than 0.70 for upland forests, and evergreen forests sustained significantly more damage than deciduous forests. The recovery of evergreen forests was on average 11 days earlier and faster than that of mangroves. Mangrove recovery was mostly limited by inundation-related factors such as elevation, slope, and drainage capacity. While higher elevation relates to slower recovery for upland forests, it favors mangrove recovery. Particularly, mangrove recovery is facilitated by river presence, explaining 65% variation in RR.

We investigated the knowledge gaps in terms of potential spatial diversity, intertidal zonation, and the historic state of mangrove forest species, and tested the role of environmental factors such as topography, as well as rehabilitation practices on diversity. Diversity and complexity indices, surface elevation, and species and structural diversities along three simplified transect lines over a broad geographical area and under various management practices were analyzed in Trat province, Thailand. Quantitative statistical zonation analyses within each transect and at the landscape-scale were performed using randomization tests and hierarchical cluster analysis. A modified automatic regrowth monitoring algorithm (ARMA), based on Landsat (1987-2020) and Sentinel-2 MSI (2015-2020) annual median composites was also used. Fifteen species were identified, with Ceriops tagal as the dominant species.

Our objective is to develop a remote sensing-based approach combining satellite data derived from optical (Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1), and LiDAR (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) platforms for rapid assessment of post-cyclone inundation in non-forested areas and vegetation damage in a primarily forested ecosystem. We apply this multi-scalar approach for assessing damages caused by the cyclone Amphan that hit coastal India and Bangladesh in May 2020, severely flooding several districts in the two countries, and causing destruction to the Sundarban mangrove forests. Our analysis shows that at least 6821 sq. km. land across the 39 study districts was inundated even after 10 days after the cyclone.

As part of a regional effort to generate detailed open-source maps of mangrove cover for Central American countries, we used Sentinel-2 MSI satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine to generate a 10 m resolution map of mangrove cover for Panama for 2020. We estimated total mangrove cover at 1836.9 (SE 157.6) km(2), an additional 308.8 km(2) compared to the Global Mangrove Watch v3.0 estimate based on Landsat, ALOS PALSAR, and Sentinel data at a coarser resolution. To determine if this discrepancy was due to differences in the spatial resolution of source data or training points and workflow, we applied our workflow to 2020 Landsat 8 OLI data and estimated 1853.0 (SE 123.5) km(2) of mangrove cover for Panama, similar to the result of the Sentinel-2 analysis and an additional 324.8 km(2) compared to the Global Mangrove Watch estimate. To understand impacts of different management types on mangrove cover, we estimated cover for 1999 using Landsat 5 TM data for comparison with our 2020 estimate from Landsat data. Although we estimated that total national mangrove cover was 98.0 km(2) (+5.6%) higher in 2020 than in 1999, this difference was smaller than the standard error of either estimate and we cannot definitively conclude that mangrove cover increased.

Despite the fact that these plant communities have proven effective in coastal area protection against typhoons and tsunamis, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami caused the destruction of a large areas of mangrove forests in the Andaman and Nicobar islands in the Bay of Bengal. In this study, we investigated the decadal changes in mangrove forests in this region, including the decline in the mangrove areas before and after the 2004 Tsunami and the recent changes in the tsunami devastated mangrove areas since then, using Landsat series and Sentinel 2 data. In order to understand how these mangrove forests survive under the sea level rising scenarios, we estimated the possible changes in the land cover when a 1m rise in the current sea level occurs. It is estimated that 15% of the mangrove areas in this region were lost between 1988 and 2018. Even though the overall mangrove areas were shrinking, its causes are relatively different from the north to the south of the Andaman Islands. While the mangrove forests in the southern regions can be affected by natural phenomena such as tsunamis and sea level rise, those in the northern region are being depleted due to logging and land use changes. It is estimated that a 1m rise in the current sea level will result in the loss of 17% (117 km(2)) of the mangrove areas (the inward migration of mangrove vegetation was not considered).

To date, most research on ecological quality has focused on areas with extremely fragile ecology and/or is related to LULP analysis. There are few studies in the literature focusing on the impact of high-intensity human activities caused by relevant policies on urban LULPs. The purpose of this research was to design a framework that monitors urban ecological security by considering the effect of the developing free trade port. The proposed framework was constructed by integrating multi-temporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing images, night light remote sensing data, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and spectral index features such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), bare soil index (BSI), and normalized intertidal mangrove index (NIMI), as well as analytical approaches such as the land use transfer matrix, land use dynamic degree, land use degree and transfer matrix, land use gravity center measurement, and landscape pattern index. The framework takes advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform and was applied to a highly developed Haikou city, the capital of Hainan province. Maps of brightness (SBI), greenness (GVI), and humidity (WET) were created annually from 2016 to 2021, enabling detailed ecological environment quality evaluation and analysis. The advantages of this study are (1) reliable land cover results obtained automatically and quickly; (2) the strong objectivity of the quantitative research on landscape patterns and land use; and (3) deep integration with free trade port policies. Through the research on the ecological quality problems caused by the change in LULP in the study area, the research results show that, from 2016 to 2021, the spatial distribution of land use and landscape pattern in Haikou city had been constantly changing; the area of construction land has decreased, with most of it having been converted into forest land and farmland; the gravity center of the building land has moved to the northwest; the degree of landscape fragmentation has decreased and the heterogeneity of landscape distribution has increased; the free trade port policies have promoted Haikou's economic development and ecological civilization construction; and finally, Haikou's ecological environmental quality has improved significantly.",mangrove index,Q1,MDPI (Sustainability),journal,"Sentinel-2, DEM, night light data",LULP; ecological quality; Google Earth Engine (GEE); Hainan Free Trade Port Plan (HFTPP),LAND-USE CHANGE; CROPLAND EXTENT; LANDSCAPE,elimine,used ENVI tool

In addition to extent information, studies such as mangrove composition, ecology, and distribution analysis require further information on mangrove zonation. Mangrove zonation refers to unique sections within a mangrove forest being dominated by a similar family, genus, or species. This can be observed both in natural and planted mangrove forests. In this study, a mapping workflow was developed to detect zonation in test mangrove forest sites in Katunggan-It Ibajay (KII) Ecopark (Aklan), Bintuan (Coron), Bogtong, and Sagrada (Busuanga) in the Philippines and Fukido Mangrove Park (Ishigaki, Japan) using Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology was then applied to generate a nationwide mangrove zonation map of the Philippines for year 2020. Combination of biophysical products, water, and vegetation indices were used as classification inputs including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation (FAPAR), Canopy chlorophyll content (Cab), canopy water content (Cw), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI), and red-edge inflection point (REIP). Mangrove extents were first mapped using either the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm or the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI)-based methodology. The biophysical and vegetation indices within these areas were stacked and transformed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Regions of Interest (ROIs) were selected on the PCA bands as training input to the MLC. Results show that mangrove zonation maps can highlight the major mangrove zones in the study sites, commonly limited up to genera level only except for genera with only one known species thriving in the area. Four zones were detected in KII Ecopark: Avicennia zone, Nypa zone, Avicennia mixed with Nypa zone, and mixed mangroves zones. For Coron and Busuanga, the mapped mangrove zones are mixed mangroves, Rhizophora zone and sparse/damaged zones. Three zones were detected in Fukido site: Rhizophora stylosa-dominant zone, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza-dominant zone, and mixed mangrove zones. The zonation maps were validated using field plot data and orthophotos generated from Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) surveys, with accuracies ranging from 75 to 100%.",mangrove extent,Q1,Frontiers in Remote Sensing,journal,Sentinel-2,mangrove forest; mangrove zonation; mangrove extent; Sentinel-2; biophysical layers,LEAF-AREA INDEX; LAND-COVER; CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION; VEGETATION INDEX; HYPERION DATA; FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; ISLANDS; LAI; DISCRIMINATION,elimine,éliminer un article dans une base écologique

Tambolongan at Bontosikuyu district was the largest area of about 132 hectares. These values extracted using Landsat imageries based on visual and composite image classification. Since Sentinel 2A launched in 2015, the use of this satellite imagery has spread widely in ecosystem monitoring due to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and mostly because it is free to access. Nevertheless, field sampling is still needed to crosscheck the final result. Since 2015 three mangrove locations at Selayar island monitored annually. By 2018, two new locations at Pasi island added. In 2019 three sites added at two different islands, so now a total nine mangrove station covering the whole Selayar islands. Nine species of mangroves were found by the end of 2019 monitoring, which are Avicennia alba, A. officinalis, A. marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, R. stylosa, Cerios tagal, and Sonneratia alba. Spectral image characterization by using 12 bands of Sentinel 2A shows that most of these mangroves had peak reflectances at 783 and 865 nanometer, and the highest reflectance are lower than 0.45.

Their degradation inevitably reduces the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately impacts human well-being, especially in coastal communities of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS). To timely identify and manage stressors causing local mangrove degradation, in situ monitoring is required. However, the financial means and human capacity to do so are often limited in SIDS, hampering adequate management of their mangrove forests. In search of a cost-effective alternative, we evaluated the use of Sentinel-2 satellites to monitor mangrove extent and species distribution in Lac Bay, a bay located on the small tropical island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). We also evaluated the mangrove's ecological condition through two biophysical variables 1) Effective Leaf Area Index (LAIe) and 2) Net Primary Productivity (NPP). Our results showed that Sentinel-2 data are a valuable tool for mapping the extent of mangrove forests in Bonaire and species composition (mean overall accuracy > 95 %). Using five Sentinel-2 images from 2021 and 2022, the extent of mangrove forests in Lac Bay was estimated to be on average 222.3 ha, of which 136.0 ha were classified as Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and 77.1 ha as Avicennia germinans (black mangrove). Mean values for predicted LAIe ranged from 3.37 to 3.85 for Lac Bay, with significantly higher values in the wet season (3.82 +/- 0.57) compared to the dry season (3.40 +/- 0.56). The generic Simplified Level-2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) underestimated the LAIe values in Lac Bay, with moderate differences between SL2P values and in situ data (BDE = 0.41, RMSE = 1.09). Mean NPP values were estimated to be 8.82 +/- 1.46 (g Cm-2 d -1). LAIe and NPP maps showed a zonal distribution, with highest values in the mid-West and East on the seaward side, and lowest values in the northern landward part of Lac Bay.

Climatic change and increase in sea level cause risk to these ecosystems. Hence, tracking the extent of mangroves leads to proper management and restoring the damaged ones. Existing index methods for mapping the mangrove extent often struggle with cloud cover, while the studies that feed direct image inputs to models face spatial resolution misalignment, limiting accurate analysis. To overcome these challenges this paper proposes a novel cloud-masked feature extraction (CMFE) approach, integrating bit masking, median compositing, and multi-band spectral sampling for precise mangrove analysis. Our approach utilizes multispectral imagery from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for Landsat 8 and Copernicus for Sentinel 2, leveraging quality assurance (QA) bands for cloud bit masking to nullify cloud and shadow pixels. Cloud cover obscures large portions of satellite imagery and reduces data availability. The median composite technique reconstructs missing or obscured information by aggregating temporal pixel statistics. Spectral and textural attributes are systematically extracted from multiple bands and structured into feature vectors, providing high-dimensional input, which overcomes the spatial resolution discrepancies. Extracted attributes are then fed to a deep learning-based model which classifies the mangroves into different density classes - sparse, moderate, and dense for mapping the dynamic changes over a decade from 2014 to 2024, focusing on Pichavaram Mangrove Forest, Tamil Nadu.

This approach enhances the accuracy of mangrove pixel classification. Accordingly, we further incorporate a quantum feature extraction (QFE) module to capture novel features. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on affine mappings, quantum neural networks (QNNs) employ unitary operations to extract quantum features. Therefore, QFE captures radically new quantum features distilled by the QNN from a fundamentally different perspective, which provides additional information for decision-making. Specifically, we fuse two different channel attention features derived from both the CNN and QNN to generate the final classification results.

These factors often lead to classification errors and indistinct species boundaries, primarily due to intraspectral variation and interspectral similarity, and also limit the capture of vertical structural features. To address these issues, we propose MSMNet, a specialised multimodal deep learning method for fine-grained mangrove species classification based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. The model uses ResNet50 as its backbone architecture and integrates the Mamba state-space module to model long-range spatial correlations. MSMNet incorporates wavelet transform technology to enhance its ability to represent textures and uses three pathways to extract three key mangrove remote sensing modalities: morphological texture, spectral features, and vegetation physiological characteristics. The design of the multimodal dynamic fusion and enhanced multiscale integration modules supports cross-modal adaptive weight allocation and efficient cross-scale feature aggregation, leveraging complementary information across dimensions. It is demonstrated by experimental results that all baseline models are significantly outperformed by MSMNet with 73.80% mIoU, 84.47% F1 score, and 99.37% overall accuracy. Compared to the second-best approach, its metrics improved by 2.25%, 1.59% and 0.06% respectively. MSMNet notably demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying key mangrove species such as Rhizophora stylosa, achieving a 4.06% accuracy improvement and significantly reducing misclassification rates at species level.

Simply speaking, CNN computes affine-mapping features, while quantum neural network (QNN) offers unitary-computing features, thereby offering a fresh perspective in the final decision-making (classification). To address the challenging MM problem, we design an entangled spatial-spectral quantum feature extraction module. Notably, to ensure that the quantum features contribute genuinely novel information (unaffected by traditional CNN features), we design a separate network track consisting solely of quantum neurons with built-in interpretability. The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with traditional feature information to jointly make the final decision.

In addition, many developing countries with extensive mangrove coverage face challenges in conducting precise monitoring due to limited technological infrastructure. To overcome these limitations, this study integrated open-access synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with optical imagery to enhance the classification accuracy of mangrove forests in the Bali Denpasar-Badung region. The Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets were used, and the U-Net deep learning model was employed for training and classification. A digital elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was applied to exclude areas higher than 10 m above sea level, thereby improving the classification accuracy. Additionally, a time-series analysis was performed to assess changes in the mangrove distribution over the past decade, revealing a consistent increase in mangrove extent in the study area. The classification performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, demonstrating that the combined SAR-optical model outperformed single-source models across all key metrics including precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

Existing local-scale studies have relied on fine but expensive data sources to map mangrove species, limiting their applicability for detecting S. apetala in large areas due to cost constraints. A previous study utilized freely available Sentinel-2 images to construct a 10-m-resolution S. apetala map in China but did not capture small clusters of S. apetala due to resolution limitations. To precisely detect S. apetala in coastal China, we proposed an approach that integrates freely accessible submeter-resolution Google Earth images to control expenses, a 10-mresolution S. apetala map to retrieve well-distributed samples, and several U-shaped networks to capture S. apetala in the form of clusters and individuals. Comparisons revealed that the lite U-squared network was most suitable for detecting S. apetala among the five U-shaped networks. The resulting map achieved an overall accuracy of 98.2 % using testing samples and an accuracy of 91.0 % using field sample plots. Statistics indicated that the total area covered by S. apetala in China was 4000.4 ha in 2022, which was 33.4 % greater than that of the 10-m-resolution map. The excessive area suggested the presence of a large number of small clusters beyond the discrimination capacity of medium-resolution images. Furthermore, the mechanism of the approach was interpreted using an example-based method that altered image color, shape, orientation, and textures. Comparisons showed that textures were the key feature for identifying S. apetala based on submeter-resolution Google Earth images. The detection accuracy rapidly decreased with the blurring of textures, and images at zoom levels of 20, 19, and 18 were applicable to the trained network. Utilizing the first individual-level map, we estimated the number of mature S. apetala trees to be approximately 2.35 million with a 95 % confidence interval between 2.30 and 2.40 million, providing a basis for managing this exotic mangrove species. This study deepens existing research on S. apetala by providing an approach with a clear mechanism, an individual-level distribution with a much larger area, and an estimation of the number of mature trees. This study advances mangrove species mapping by combining the advantages of freely accessible medium- and high-resolution images: the former provides abundant spectral information to integrate discrete local-scale maps to generate a large-scale map, while the latter offers textural information from submeter-resolution Google Earth images to detect mangrove species in detail.",mangrove species mapping,Q1,Elsevier (ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,Sonneratia apetala; Mangrove species; U-shaped networks; Submeter resolution; Google Earth images,LIDAR DATA; CLASSIFICATION,non lu,

Thus, accurate mapping and monitoring of relevant land covers in mangrove ecosystems are crucial for effective conservation and management efforts. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for mangrove ecosystem mapping using a Hybrid Selective Kernel-based Convolutional Neural Network (HSK-CNN) framework and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. A time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products derived from Sentinel-2 imagery was produced to capture the temporal behavior of land cover types in the dynamic ecosystem of the study area. The proposed algorithm integrated Selective Kernel-based feature extraction techniques to facilitate the effective learning and classification of multiple land cover types within the dynamic mangrove ecosystems. The model demonstrated a high Overall Accuracy (OA) of 94% in classifying eight land cover classes, including mangrove, tidal zone, water, mudflat, urban, and vegetation.

FragMangro integrates parallel multi-scale convolution for progressive dimensional upscaling, improving spectral feature extraction.

Mangrove monitoring is one of the important tasks to understand the current status of mangrove forests regarding their loss issues, including deforestation and degradation. Currently, satellite imagery is widely employed to monitor mangrove ecosystems. Sentinel-2 is an optical satellite imagery whose data are available for free, and which provides satellite imagery at a 5-day temporal resolution. Analyzing satellite images before and after loss can enhance our ability to detect mangrove loss. This paper introduces a LSST-Former model that considers the situation before and after mangrove loss to categorize non-mangrove areas, intact mangroves, and mangrove loss categories using Sentinel-2 images for a limited number of labels. The LSST-Former model was developed by integrating a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a transformer base with few-shot learning algorithms to extract information from spectral-spatial-temporal Sentinel-2 images. The attention mechanism in the transformer algorithm may effectively mitigate the issue of limited labeled samples and enhance the accuracy of learning correlations between samples, resulting in more successful classification. The experimental findings demonstrate that the LSST-Former model achieves an overall accuracy of 99.59% and an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 98.84% for detecting mangrove loss, and the validation of universal applicability achieves an overall accuracy of more than 92% and a kappa accuracy of more than 89%.

The knowledge of mangrove conditions is essential to know the statuses of mangroves. Recently, satellite imagery has been widely used to generate mangrove and degradation mapping. Sentinel-2 is a volume of free satellite image data that has a temporal resolution of 5 days. When Hurricane Irma hit the southwest Florida coastal zone in 2017, it caused mangrove degradation. The relationship of satellite images between pre and post-hurricane events can provide a deeper understanding of the degraded mangrove areas that were affected by Hurricane Irma. This study proposed an MDPrePost-Net that considers images before and after hurricanes to classify non-mangrove, intact/healthy mangroves, and degraded mangroves classes affected by Hurricane Irma in southwest Florida using Sentinel-2 data. MDPrePost-Net is an end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) that consists of two main sub-models. The first sub-model is a pre-post deep feature extractor used to extract the spatial-spectral-temporal relationship between the pre, post, and mangrove conditions after the hurricane from the satellite images and the second sub-model is an FCN classifier as the classification part from extracted spatial-spectral-temporal deep features. Experimental results show that the accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) score by the proposed MDPrePost-Net for degraded mangrove are 98.25% and 96.82%, respectively.

Despite their significant ecological role, in many areas, including in Vietnam, large scale losses have occurred, although restoration efforts have been underway. Understanding the scale of the loss and the efficacy of restoration requires high resolution temporal monitoring of mangrove cover on large scales. We have produced a time series of 10-m-resolution mangrove cover maps using the Multispectral Instrument on the Sentinel 2 satellites and with this tool measured the changes in mangrove distribution on the Vietnamese Southern Coast (VSC). We extracted the annual mangrove cover ranging from 2016 to 2023 using a deep learning model with a U-Net architecture based on 17 spectral indices. Additionally, a comparison of misclassification by the model with global products was conducted, indicating that the U-Net architecture demonstrated superior performance when compared to experiments including multispectral bands of Sentinel-2 and time-series of Sentinel-1 data, as shown by the highest performing spectral indices. The generated performance metrics, including overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were above 90 % for entire years. Water indices were investigated as the most important variables for mangrove extraction.

Precise and rapid mapping of mangrove forests has thus become highly relevant, which can provide essential information to support the conservation practices of such blue carbon resources.

This study developed a generalized approach for large-area mangrove mapping using a hybrid neural network integrated with a vision transformer to effectively capture representative features. To adapt mangrove mapping to the variety of tidal conditions, a vision transformer architecture was developed by encoding the fusion of three Sentinel-2 bands: Green, NIR, and SWIR.

In 2020, we conducted various experiments related to mangrove classification by tuning input features and hyper-parameters. The selected ANN model was used with a transfer learning approach to predict the mangrove distribution in 2015. Changes were detected using classification results from 2015 and 2020.

The study of mangrove species distribution is the basis of carbon storage research. In this study, we explored the potential of combining optical (Gaofen-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-9) and fully polarized synthetic aperture radar data from different periods (Gaofen-3) to distinguish mangrove species in the Fucheng town of Leizhou, Guangdong Province. The Gaofen-1 data were fused with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 satellite data, respectively. The new data after fusion had both high spatial and spectral resolution. The backscattering coefficient and polarization decomposition parameters of the fully polarized SAR data which could characterize the canopy structure of mangroves were extracted. Ten different feature combinations were designed by combining the two types of data. The extremely randomized trees algorithm (ERT) was used to classify the species, and the optimal feature subset was selected by the feature selection algorithm on the basis of the ERT, and the importance of the features was sorted. Studies show the following: (1) When controlling a single variable, the higher the spatial resolution of the multi-spectral data, the higher the interspecific classification accuracy. (2) The coupled Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 data with a 2 m resolution will have higher classification accuracy than a single data source. (3) The selected feature subset contains all types of features in the optical data and the polarization decomposition features of the SAR data from different periods: multi-spectral band > texture feature > polarization decomposition parameter > vegetation index. Among the optimized feature combinations, the classification accuracy of mangrove species was the highest, the overall classification accuracy was 90.13%, and Kappa was 0.84, indicating that multi-source and SAR data from different periods coupling could improve the discrimination of mangrove species.

Man-groves also offer significant co-benefits, serving as nurseries for marine species, providing nutrients and food to support marine ecosystems, and stabilizing coastlines from erosion and extreme events. Given these considerations, mangrove afforestation and associated C sequestration has gained considerable attention as a nature-based solution to climate adaptation (e.g., protect against more frequent storm surges) and mitigation (e.g. offsetting other C-producing activi-ties). To advance our understanding and description of these important ecosystems, we leverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide a current assessment of mangrove extent within the Red Sea region and also explore the effect of spatial resolution on mapping accuracy. We establish that Sentinel-2 provides a more precise spatial record of extent and subsequently use these data together with a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to: i) map the distribution of Red Sea mangrove systems, and ii) identify potential areas for future afforestation. From these cur-rent and potential mangrove distribution maps, we then estimate the carbon sequestration rate for the Red Sea (as well as for each bordering country) using a meta-analysis of sequestration values surveyed from the available literature. For the mangrove classification, we obtained mapping accuracies of 98 %, with a total Red Sea mangrove extent estimated at approximately 175 km(2). Based on the MaxEnt approach, which used soil physical and environmental variables to identify the key factors limiting mangrove growth and distribution, an area of nearly 410 km(2) was identified for potential mangrove afforestation expansion. The factors constraining the potential distribution of mangroves were re-lated to soil physical properties, likely reflecting the low sediment load and limited nutrient input of the Red Sea. The current rate of carbon sequestration was calculated as 1034.09 +/- 180.53 Mg C yr(-1), and the potential sequestration rate as 2424.49 +/- 423.26 Mg C yr(-1).

Satellite images have been extensively employed for S. alterniflora invasion monitoring; however, there are still several issues that need to be addressed. The spectral similarities between S. alterniflora and surrounding ground objects make it challenging for traditional classifiers to achieve satisfactory extraction accuracy. Since the phenological information and red-edge spectral differences have been considered as informative features for identifying S. alterniflora, current studies mainly used them separately as classification features and seldom considered the differences of red-edge information at different phenological periods. Therefore, we proposed a pixel-based phenological and red-edge feature composite method (PpRef-CM) for S. alterniflora extraction considering both phenological information and red-edge bands derived from Sentinel-2 time series based on the existing pixel-based phenological feature composite method (Ppf-CM). The proposed PpRef-CM and machine-learning algorithms were employed for S. alterniflora extraction in two typical mangrove forests along coastal China. Results indicated that red-edge information at different phenological periods is essential for detecting S. alterniflora. S. alterniflora extraction achieved the highest accuracy of 96.57% by using the eXtreme gradient boost algorithm when compared with other machine-learning algorithms. The PpRef-CM gave 2.72% and 2.61% more extraction accuracies of S. alterniflora than the Ppf-CM in two study sites, separately.

While it has been well accepted that phenological information derived from multitemporal remotely sensed data improves vegetation mapping accuracy, previous research primarily relied on scene-based features for invasive plant mapping. In the coastal regions with frequent cloud cover such as South China coast, extracting phenological features at scene level was impossible due to lack of sufficient cloud-free imageries. In this study, we aimed to propose a simple phenological vegetation index (PVI) using pixel-level composition of Sentinel-2 observations with the assist of Google Earth Engine platform. By developing and comparing six PVIs, separability analysis showed that phenological normalized vegetation difference index (PNDVI) of S. alterniflora and other land cover types were more separable than other PVIs and single-season NDVI. Based on the PNDVI, we further proposed supervised and unsupervised Otsu thresholding methods for S. alterniflora extraction. The overall accuracies of supervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method using 10-fold cross validation reached 97.84%, and that of the unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method reached 97.20%. Kappa Z-test statistics showed that both supervised and unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding methods yielded statistically similar accuracies as random forest classifiers based on six PVIs, and higher accuracies than scene-based classification. The success of the unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method suggested that the method was practical and operational for S. alterniflora mapping and its expansion monitoring in wide area such as South China coast.",vegetation mapping,Q1,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,journal,Sentinel-2,Google Earth Engine (GEE);invasive species;phenological vegetation index (PVI);phenology;Sentinel-2; $Spartina\ alterniflora$,,non lu,

The species composition of a mangrove forest has been estimated utilising the red-edge spectral bands and chlorophyll absorption information from AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 data. In this study, three dominant species, Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Avicennia officinalis, have been classified using the random forest (RF) model for a mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Various combinations of reflectance/backscatter bands and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2, AVIRIS-NG, and Sentinel-1 were used for species-level discrimination and mapping. The RF model showed maximum accuracy using Sentinel-2, followed by the AVIRIS-NG, in discriminating three dominant species and two mixed compositions. This study indicates the potential of Sentinel-2 data for discriminating various mangrove species owing to the appropriate placement of central wavelength and bandwidth in Sentinel-2 at >= 10 m spatial resolution.

In particular, mangrove canopy assessments using remote sensing methods can be undertaken rapidly and, if freely available, optimize costs. Although such spaceborne data have been used for such purposes, their application to map mangroves at the species level has been limited by the capacity to provide continuous data. The objective of this study was to assess mangrove seasonal patterns using seven multispectral vegetation indices based on a Sentinel-2 (S2) time series (July 2018 to October 2019) to assess phenological trajectories of various semiarid mangrove classes in the Google Earth Engine platform using Fourier analysis for an area located in Western Mexico. The results indicate that the months from November through December and from May through July were critical in mangrove species discrimination using the EVI2, NDVI, and VARI series. The Random Forest classification accuracy for the S2 image was calculated at 79% during the optimal acquisition period (June 25, 2019), whereas only 55% accuracy was calculated for the non-optimal image acquired date (March 2, 2019). Although mangroves are considered evergreen forests, the phenological pattern of various mangrove canopies, based on these indices, were shown to be very similar to the surrounding land-based semiarid deciduous forest. Consequently, it is believed that the rainfall pattern is likely to be the key environmental factor driving mangrove phenology in this semiarid coastal system and thus the degree of success in mangrove remote sensing classification endeavors.

They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km(2). The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover. Mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user's accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low.

But in China, they have been suffering from severe invasion by Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). Accurate information on spatial distribution of mangroves and S. alterniflora is a prerequisite to protecting indigenous mangrove ecosystems and managing S. alterniflora invasion. However, the classification performance is often constrained by two major issues: (1) A single-date image, regardless of acquisition time, hardly provides optimal spectral separability among evergreen mangroves, deciduous S. alterniflora and mudflats; (2) Due to the gradual invasion process, the mixtures between land cover classes are prevalent in moderate-resolution images. The use of high-resolution (finer than 2 m) image time series could effectively solve these two issues. However, due to frequent cloud cover in coastal areas and long revisit time of high-resolution satellite sensors, the collection of high-resolution image time series is still a great challenge, let alone substantial expenses. In this study, we proposed a new multi-temporal classification approach to fine-scale mapping of exotic S. alterniflora and native mangroves using synthetic high-resolution image time series derived from spatiotemporal fusion of WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 data. A total of six synthetic WorldView-2-like images in different phenological periods were produced by the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method. With the combination of the original and synthetic images, both types of image-based multi-temporal features and pixel-based image compositing features were extracted and evaluated in the following Random Forest classifications. Monte Carlo cross-validation was adopted to provide robust accuracy estimates, and a spatially explicit confidence map was generated to show classification uncertainty and potential errors. In order to further demonstrate the necessity of generating synthetic WorldView-2 images, the entire classification process was repeated using Sentinel-2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and the comparison between fine-and moderate resolution classification results was made in terms of classification accuracies, classification maps and fractional abundances. Our results show that the spectral profiles of S. alterniflora and mangroves generated from the synthetic WorldView-2 images were consistent with the ones from the paired Sentinel-2 images. Meanwhile, the spatial details of high landscape heterogeneity, unrecognizable in the Sentinel-2 images, were revealed by the synthetic WorldView-2 images. Compared to the single-date classification with the original WorldView-2 image, most of multi-temporal classifications using both the original and synthetic images provided more accurate results, with the overall accuracy raised by up to 3.9%. Among various temporal features adopted in this study, the use of the image-based, stacked spectral reflectance and vegetation index features of all original and synthetic images produced the best classification performance, increasing the producer's and user's accuracies of mangroves, S. alterniflora and mudflats by 2.5%-7.1%. Finally, the Sentinel-2 classification accuracies were generally lower than the WorldView-2 counterparts across all temporal features, with a 6% difference in the highest overall accuracy between the two. Prediction errors of the moderate-resolution classification were often found in heterogeneous landscapes, where S. alterniflora was mixed with mangroves or mudflats. Considering the availability of moderate-resolution data with high revisit frequencies, such as Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat 8/9, future fine scale mapping exercises might benefit from the multi-temporal classification approach with spatiotemporal fusion of moderate-and high-resolution data, alleviating the problem of the scarcity of high-resolution data in cloudy areas.",mangrove forests,Q1,Elsevier (Remote Sensing of Environment),journal,"Sentinel-2, World view-2",Mangrove forests; Invasive species; FSDAF; Sentinel-2; WorldView-2; Time series; Classification,SURFACE REFLECTANCE; VEGETATION INDEXES; PLANT INVASIONS; SATELLITE DATA; TIME-SERIES; LANDSAT-TM; LEAF-AREA; CHINA; SENTINEL-2; ACCURACY,non lu,

The detailed distribution of mangrove species on a national scale remains a challenge, impeding species -specific applications in the ecology and management of mangroves, as well as evaluations of related Sustainable Development Goals. Although local -scale studies have explored various data sources, the variability of plant phenology is the key factor preventing their generalization from local areas to large latitudinal spans (e.g., the coast of China). The separability time period, defined by a separability metric for each scene of the image time series, provides a potential way to tackle the aforementioned problem. We conducted a case study on mapping Kandelia obovata in China based on Sentinel -2 time -series imagery, as it is a representative native mangrove species with the largest latitudinal span and tolerance to low temperatures. The proposed approach considered the separability between K. obovata and its typical co-occurring mangrove species, as well as that between K. obovata and salt marshes. The overall accuracy of the generated K. obovata map in China for 2020 reached 88.5% based on independently collected samples.

By taking advantage of this principle, the study applied some mangrove and non-mangrove VIs as predictor variables sourced from monthly Sentinel-2 data. These variables were grouped by individual VIs and fed into the random forest algorithm to derive phenology-based classification. A suitable month for thresholding mangroves across different VIs was also ascertained. Results indicated that phenology-based classification with three classes was more accurate (95% overall accuracy) than threshold-based or WorldCover v100 classifications.

Additionally, this research provides the first spatiotemporal health assessment of Pakistan's national mangrove cover as well. Rational analysis of the results indicated splitting the entire timeline based on two seasons (Jan-Jun and Jul-Dec). Results revealed an overall increase of 1,210 km(2) (2023) in the mangrove cover on the national-level; a 3.42 km(2) average annual increase from 2016 (1,186 km(2)). Mangrove gain/loss assessment based on the land use land cover (LULC) transition matrix illustrated 223 km(2) gain and 199 km(2) loss; a 24 km(2) net gain.

To overcome the current limitation of 10-m resolution, we developed a novel Semi-automatic Sub-meter Mapping Method (SSMM). The SSMM enhances the spectral separability of mangroves from other land covers by selecting nine critical features from both Sentinel-2 and Google Earth imagery. We also developed an innovative automated sample collection method to ensure ample and precise training samples, increasing sample density in areas susceptible to misclassification and reducing it in uniform regions. This method surpasses traditional uniform sampling in representing the national-scale study area. The classification is performed using a random forest classifier and is manually refined, culminating in the production of the pioneering Large-scale Sub-meter Mangrove Map (LSMM). Our study showcases the LSMM's superior performance over the established High-resolution Global Mangrove Forest (HGMF) map. The LSMM demonstrates enhanced classification accuracy, improved spatial delineation, and more precise area calculations, along with a robust framework of spatial analysis. Notably, compared to the HGMF, the LSMM achieves a 22.0 % increase in overall accuracy and a 0.27 improvement in the F1 score. In terms of mangrove coverage within China, the LSMM estimates a reduction of 4,345 ha (15.4 %), decreasing from 32,598 ha in the HGMF to 28,253 ha. This reduction is further underscored by a significant 61.7 % discrepancy in spatial distribution areas when compared to the HGMF, indicative of both commission and omission errors associated with the 10-m HGMF. Additionally, the LSMM identifies a fivefold increase in the number of mangrove patches, totaling 40,035, compared to the HGMF's 7,784. These findings underscore the substantial improvements offered by sub-meter resolution products over those with a 10-m resolution.

Various machine learning algorithms were employed to perform species-level classification on Sentinel-2 multispectral data and to assess the spatio-temporal changes in the species distribution between 2019 and 2023, with Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting outperforming other classifiers (overall accuracy >90 %, kappa >0.9). Long-term (1988-2023) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends were analyzed using the non-parametric Theil-Sen's Slope. Furthermore, harmonic regression modelled species phenology from Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices and demonstrated enhanced species differentiation using temporal parametric model metrics. The change detection analysis revealed significant interspecies interactions, indicating species competition and degradation in the Bhitarkanika and Pichavaram ecosystems.

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping.

Here, based on Sentinel-2 imagery, we created a global mangrove forest dataset at 10-m resolution, namely, High-resolution Global Mangrove Forests (HGMF_2020), using object-based image analysis and random forest classification. We then analyzed the status of global mangrove forests from the perspectives of conserva-tion, threats, and resistance to ocean disasters. We concluded the following: (1) globally, there were 145,068 km2 mangrove forests in 2020, among which Asia contained the largest coverage (39.2%); at the country level, Indonesia had the largest amount of mangrove forests, followed by Brazil and Australia. (2) Mangrove forests in South Asia were estimated to be in the better status due to the higher proportion of conservation and larger individual patch size; in contrast, mangrove forests in East and Southeast Asia were facing intensive threats.

However, accurately mapping mangrove extent and species are ongoing challenges in remote sensing. The newly-launched and freely-available Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor offers a new opportunity for these challenges. This study presents the first study dedicated to the examination of the potential of original bands, spectral indices, and texture information of S2 in mapping mangrove extent and species in the first National Nature Reserve for mangroves in Dongzhaigang, China. To map mangrove extent and species, a three-level hierarchical structure based on the spatial structure of a mangrove ecosystem and geographic object-based image analysis is utilized and modified. During the experiments, to conquer the challenge of optimizing high-dimension and correlated feature space, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm is introduced. Finally, the selected features from RFE are employed in mangrove species discriminations, based on a random forest algorithm. The results are compared with those of Landsat 8 (L8) and Pleiades-1 (P1) data and show that S2 and L8 could accurately extract mangrove extent, but P1 obviously overestimated it. Regarding mangrove species community levels, the overall classification accuracy of S2 is 70.95%, which is lower than P1 imagery (78.57%) and slightly higher than L8 data (68.57%). Meanwhile, the former difference is statistically significant, and the latter is not. The dominant species is extracted basically in S2 and P1 imagery, but for the occasionally distributed K. candel and the pioneer and fringe mangrove A. marina, S2 performs poorly. Concerning L8, S2, and P1, there are eight (8/126), nine (9/218), and eight (8/73) features, respectively, that are the most important for mangrove species discriminations. The most important feature overall is the red-edge bands, followed by shortwave infrared, near infrared, blue, and other visible bands in turn. This study demonstrates that the S2 sensor can accurately map mangrove extent and basically discriminate mangrove species communities, but for the latter, one should be cautious due to the complexity of mangrove species.",mapping mangrove,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,"Sentinel-2, Landsat, Pleades",mangroves; species; Sentinel-2; Landsat 8; Pleiades-1; random forest,OBJECT-BASED CLASSIFICATION; GROWING STOCK VOLUME; RANDOM FOREST; CANOPY COVER; TIME-SERIES; SATELLITE; BIOMASS; FEATURES; ALGORITHMS; IMAGERY,lu,

Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach, and the accurate and stable results achieved through cross-validation and consistency checks confirmed its robustness and applicability.

However, recent national-scale mangrove forest maps are mainly derived from 30-m Landsat imagery, and their spatial resolution is relatively coarse to accurately characterize the extent of mangroves, especially those with small size. Now, Sentinel imagery with 10-m resolution provides an opportunity for generating high-resolution mangrove maps containing these small mangrove patches. Here, we used spectral/backscatter-temporal variability metrics (quantiles) derived from Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and/or Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) time-series imagery as input features of random forest to classify mangroves in China. We found that Sentinel-2 (F1-Score of 0.895) is more effective than Sentinel-1 (F1-score of 0.88) in mangrove extraction, and a combination of SAR and MSI imagery can get the best accuracy (F1-score of 0.94). The 10-m mangrove map was derived by combining SAR and MSI data, which identified 20003 ha mangroves in China, and the area of small mangrove patches (<1 ha) is 1741 ha, occupying 8.7% of the whole mangrove area. At the province level, Guangdong has the largest area (819 ha) of small mangrove patches, and in Fujian, the percentage of small mangrove patches is the highest (11.4%). A comparison with existing 30-m mangrove products showed noticeable disagreement, indicating the necessity for generating mangrove extent product with 10-m resolution.

With freely available satellite data archives and cloud computing resources, it is now more accessible to conduct such large-scale monitoring and assessment. Yet, few studies examine the reproducibility of such mangrove monitoring frameworks, especially in terms of generating consistent spatial extent. Our objective was to evaluate a combination of image processing approaches to classify mangrove forests along the coast of Senegal and The Gambia. We used freely available global satellite data (Sentinel-2), and cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine) to run two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART). We calibrated and validated the algorithms using 800 reference points collected using high-resolution images. We further re-ran 10 iterations for each algorithm, utilizing unique subsets of the initial training data. While all iterations resulted in thematic mangrove maps with over 90% accuracy, the mangrove extent ranges between 827-2807 km(2) for Senegal and 245-1271 km(2) for The Gambia with one outlier for each country. We further report Places of Agreement (PoA) to identify areas where all iterations for both methods agree (506.6 km(2) and 129.6 km(2) for Senegal and The Gambia, respectively), thus have a high confidence in predicting mangrove extent. While we acknowledge the time- and cost-effectiveness of such methods for the landscape managers, we recommend utilizing them with utmost caution, as well as post-classification on-the-ground checks, especially for decision making.",mangrove mapping,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,Sentinel-2,mangrove; machine-learning algorithms; google earth engine; random forest; CART; Senegal; The Gambia; Africa,MULTITEMPORAL SATELLITE DATA; LAND-COVER CHANGE; FOREST COVER; ALOS PALSAR; BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; EARTH-OBSERVATION; REMOTE; CLASSIFICATION; SUNDARBANS; DYNAMICS,lu,

Model internals and tacit knowledge were neglected, such as a large number of decision rules provided by random forest (RF) analyses. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to emphasize the interpretability of an approach. However, current knowledge-based mangrove mapping approaches rely on extensive experiments. Thus, they cannot be easily updated to accommodate new issues, such as prevalent false positives resulting from insufficient consideration of the spectral mixture of vegetation and water in existing studies. To combine the advantages of black-box-based approaches with high update rates and knowledge-based approaches with high interpretability, this study developed a knowledge extraction method by parsing trained RF models, reconstructing decision rules to incorporate the ensemble procedure, and selecting the optimal decision rule as the target. Using this method, an interpretable mangrove mapping approach (IMMA) consisting of five features was constructed, which derived from Sentinel-2 image bands and a digital elevation model: B12 < 0.06 & B8/B2 > 3.50 & elevation < 4.70 & mangrove vegetation index (MVI) > 2.92 & normalized difference index4 (NDI) < 0.07. The study achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 82.3% along the entire coast of China using test samples. Comparatively, it achieved an OA of 78.8% in south Florida, with no training samples for the RF models. The IMMA approach had a limited number of false positives compared with the black-box-based and knowledge-based approaches. By analyzing, we found B12 < 0.06 & B8/B2 > 3.50 & elevation < 4.70 dominated the IMMA to achieve comparable classification results to the existing studies, and B8/B2 > 3.50 was the key to suppressing the false positives resulting from the spectral mixture. The IMMA provided a bridge between training samples and interpretable decision rules, a tool to discover new knowledge, a key to improving fundamental scientific understanding of mangrove mapping, and an alternative to black-box algorithms in the XAI era expandable to various fields.",mangrove mapping,Q1,Elsevier (ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing),journal,"Sentinel-2, DEM",Mangrove mapping; Knowledge extraction; Decision rules; Random forest; Explainable artificial intelligence,GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE; CHINA; CONSERVATION; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOMASS; HEIGHT,lu,

However, the efficiency and accuracy of MF mapping based on these two data is not clear, especially for large-scale applications. To address this issue, first, we developed a robust classification approach by integrating object-based image analysis (OBIA) and random forest (RF) algorithm; and then, applied this approach to GF-2 and S2 images to map the extents of MF along the entire coasts of Guangxi, China, respectively; at last, compared the efficiency and accuracy of GF-2 and S2 imagery in MF mapping. Results showed that: first, based on OBIA and RF integrated classification approach both MF maps derived from GF-2 and S2 obtained high mapping accuracies (the overall accuracy was 96% and 94%, respectively); second, areal extent of MFs in Guangxi extracted from GF-2 and S2 images was 8182 and 8040 ha, respectively; third, GF-2 imagery has extraordinary abilities in detecting fragmented MF patches located along landward and seaward edges; and finally, S2 imagery performed better in detecting seaward submerged MFs and separating MF from terrestrial vegetation.

We examined the potential of original bands, spectral indices, including combined mangrove recognition index (CMRI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and principal component analysis (PCA) of Sentinel-2 to map the mangrove of Dongzhaigang, China in June 2019. Random forest (RF) approach was adopted for the image classification. Results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the image classification can achieve 90.47% and 0.86. The area of mangrove of Dongzhaigang, China in June 2019 is 17.83 km(2). The importance of each variable was calculated and among all the 15 variables, the CMRI ranked first, followed by NDVI, band 3 (green), band 2 (blue), and PCA1 (the first principal component) in turn. Based on the results, we can conclude that vegetation indices and PCA are essential for mangrove extent mapping since the variable importance of these features are relatively higher in the ranking of mean decrease Gini. Also band 3 (green band) provides important information for distinguishing mangrove from land and water class.

However, they have been rapidly declining during the previous two decades. What is critical to understanding the growth of mangrove species and better assessing the value of their ecological services is the knowledge gained about mangrove mapping. Since mangrove forests grow primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, and in these areas, the sky is usually cloudy, we used a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. A random forest algorithm is used to investigate the potential of Sentinel images for the extraction of mangrove forests in southern Iran, and seven spectral indices were used for better monitoring of mangrove forests. Our research was focused on three questions: (1) For mangrove forests mapping, whether Sentinel imagery, Sentinel-1 SAR data, or Sentinel-2 multispectral data, is more accurate; (2) which Sentinel imaging feature combination produces the best appropriate mangrove forests map; (3) how does a 10-m resolution map increase our understanding of the distribution of mangrove forests when compared to 30-m resolution mangrove products obtained from Landsat imagery? This study showed that the Sentinel-2 time-series images with an F1-score (0.89) are more effective in extracting the mangrove map than the Sentinel-1 time-series images with an F1-score (0.83).

The main objective of this study is to evaluate mangrove classifications derived from a combination of Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 observations using a random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm to identify the best approach for monitoring Guyana's mangrove forests on an annual basis.

The combined optical-radar classification demonstrated the best performance with an overall accuracy of 95%. Area estimates of mangrove extent ranged from 908.4 to 3645.0 hectares. A ground-based validation exercise confirmed the extent of several large, previously undocumented areas of mangrove forest loss. The results establish that a data fusion approach combining optical and radar data performs marginally better than optical-only approaches to mangrove classification.

Remote sensing is essential for monitoring their evolution, yet its effectiveness is hindered in developing countries by economic and technical constraints. In addressing this issue, this paper introduces MANGLEE (Mangrove Mapping and Monitoring Tool in Google Earth Engine), an accessible, adaptable, and multipurpose tool designed to address the challenges associated with sustainable mangrove management. Leveraging remote sensing data, machine learning techniques (Random Forest), and change detection methods, MANGLEE consists of three independent modules. The first module acquires, processes, and calculates indices of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, enhancing tracking capabilities in the presence of atmospheric interferences. The second module employs Random Forest to classify mangrove and non-mangrove areas, providing accurate binary maps. The third module identifies changes between two-time mangrove maps, categorizing alterations as losses or gains. To validate MANGLEE's effectiveness, we conducted a case study in the mangroves of Guayas, Ecuador, a region historically threatened by shrimp farming. Utilizing data from 2018 to 2022, our findings reveal a significant loss of over 2900 hectares, with 46% occurring in legally protected areas. This loss corresponds to the rapid expansion of Ecuador's shrimp industry, confirming the tool's efficacy in monitoring mangroves despite cloud cover challenges.

Satellite data at 10 to 30-m resolution, which has been available since the 1980s, has allowed the mapping and quan-tification of these dynamics. However, the plant formations have reorganized internally; this has not been well-documented, possibly because there is no established method for detecting zonation of the Senegalese mangrove. This paper proposes a two-step method for mapping the zonation of the Saloum Delta mangrove. First, mangrove surfaces were detected using machine learning methods from an object-based time series. Finally, a typology was developed through object-based clustering using time-series metrics derived from the harmonic regression modeling of the vegetation fraction. A comparison with field data allowed us to determine the number of classes and discriminating variables. The results showed that the selected method resulted in an overall accuracy of 97.55% (Kappa = 95.42) for the land cover at 4 classes (Water, Mangrove, Salt flats, Other land covers), with an F1-Score of 98.91% for the mangroves. Second, our results suggest that the annual trend of the vegetation fraction at the object scale is effective in differentiating mangrove zonation into three classes based on canopy density and stand height (HM: High mangrove; LDM: Low and dense mangrove; LOM: Low and open mangrove). Finally, the temporal stability of the classes and uncertainty around the magnitudes of the plant fraction values per class were assessed by Bayesian inference. An overall accuracy of 85.5% can be expected to identify the zonation typology on an inter-annual scale.

Mangroves are globally threatened, disappearing, and degraded. Consequently, knowledge on mangroves distribution and change is important for effective conservation and making protection policies. Developing remote sensing data and classification methods have proven to be suitable tools for mapping mangrove forests over a regional scale. Here, we scrutinized and compared the performance of pixel-based and object-based methods under Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms in mapping a mangrove ecosystem into four main classes (Mangrove tree, mudflat, water, and sand spit) using resampled and fused Senti-nel-2 images. Additionally, landscape metrics were used to identify the differences between spatial patterns obtained from different classification methods. Results showed that pixel-based classifications were influ-enced heavily by the effect of salt and pepper noise, whereas in object-based classifications, boundaries of land use land cover (LULC) polygons were smoother and visually more appealing. Object-based clas-sifications, with an excellent level of kappa, distinguished mudflat and sand spit from each other and from mangrove better than the pixel-based classifications which obtained a fair-to-good level of kappa. RF and SVM performed differently under comparable circumstances. The results of landscape metrics comparison presented that the classification methods can be affected on quantifying area and size metrics. Although the results supported the idea that fused Sentinel images may provide better results in mangrove LULC classification, further research needs to develop and evaluate various image fusion approaches to make use of all Sentinel's fine resolution images.

However, they are being destroyed at an alarming rate by human activities. To characterize mangrove forest changes, evaluate their impacts, and support relevant protection and restoration decision making, accurate and up-to-date mangrove extent mapping at large spatial scales is essential. Available large-scale mangrove extent data products use a single machine learning method commonly with 30 m Landsat imagery, and significant inconsistencies remain among these data products. With huge amounts of satellite data involved and the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics across large geographic areas, finding the most suitable method for large-scale high-resolution mangrove mapping is a challenge. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning ensemble for mangrove forest mapping at 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa using Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) imagery.

A submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) using two high- and low-tide images was recently proposed to remove the influence of tides and identify mangrove forests. However, when the tidal height of the selected low-tide image is not at the lowest tidal level, the corresponding SMRI does not function well, which results in mangrove forests below the low tidal height being undetected. Furthermore, Spartina alterniflora Loisel (S. alterniflora) was introduced to China in 1979 and rapidly spread to become the most serious invasive plant along the Chinese coastline. The current SMRI has failed to distinguish S. alterniflora from submerged mangrove forests because of their similar spectral signatures. In this study, an SMRI-based mangrove forest mapping method was developed using the time series of Sentinel-2 images to mitigate the two aforementioned issues. In the proposed method, quantile synthesis was applied to the time series of Sentinel-2 images to generate a lowest-tide synthetic image for creating SMRI to identify submerged mangrove forests. Unsubmerged mangrove forests were classified using a support vector machine, and a preliminary mangrove forest map was created by merging them. In addition, S. alterniflora was distinguished from the mangrove forests by analyzing their phenological differences. Finally, mangrove forest mapping was performed by masking S. alterniflora. The proposed method was applied to the entire coastline of the Guangxi Province, China. The results showed that it can reliably and accurately identify submerged mangrove forests derived from SMRI by synthesizing low- and high-tide images using quantile synthesis, and the differentiation of S. alterniflora using phenological differences results in more accurate mangrove mapping.

We characterized the vegetative phenological signatures of mangrove species using 82 filtered Sentinel-2 multi-temporal images from 2018 to 2020. Three vegetation indices, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), were compared to observe the mangrove vegetative phenophases trends using the GEE platform.

Each mangrove species phenophases showed that the curve value increased in the rainy season and decreased in the dry season based on the vegetation index value fluctuations. We found that using RF-based classification, we can use these phenophases patterns to differentiate between one mangrove species to another. Our finding shows that the wet months in the middle to the end of the rainy season play an important role in distinguishing between mangrove species.

The results showed that Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, Avicennia lanata, and Avicennia marina were the most common mangrove species in these areas, with reflectance values in the range of 0.002 to 0.493, 0.006 to 0.833, 0.014 to 0.768, and 0.002 to 0.758. Permutation importance (PI) that affects the classification model is the red band, near-infrared, and green normalized difference vegetation index, where the most PI in model 3 is 0.283. The highest level of agreement for mangrove species is found in model 3. Model 3 is the best parameter for RF classification that showed the best mapping accuracy, with the overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and kappa value being 81.25%, 81.68%, 81.25%, and 0.80, respectively.",mangrove species,Q2,SPIE (Journal of Applied Remote Sensing),journal,"Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2",wetland; machine learning; field spectroradiometer; spectral reflectance; near-infrared,BLUE CARBON; CLASSIFICATION; VIETNAM; SEAGRASS,elimine,

To clarify the effects of disturbances quantitatively on mangroves, spatiotemporal changes in land use and land cover (LULC) were compared between the inside and outside of mangroves during 1988 and 2020 in Bangladesh by remote sensing. The mangrove region, which had diverse surface greenness due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, were surveyed. Changes in greenness were estimated by five vegetation indices (VIs). To increase in the accuracy of land use classification, the five VIs were combined under a random forest (RF) classifier. The five VIs were: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil-adjusted VI (SAVI), green-red VI (GRVI) and enhanced VI (EVI), using data obtained from Landsat TM (30 m resolution) and Sentinel-2A (10 m) via Google Earth Engine. A Moran's I analysis showed a random pattern of training samples of LULC classes for integrated RF classification. The classification accuracy was evaluated using the reference point data with multiple comparisons of VIs and kappa coefficient. The area was classified into eight LULC classes. Although the respective VIs depicted unique characteristics, the accuracies of them were less than 89 %. The integrated classifier improved the accuracy of 96-97 % with kappa of 0.96 in 1988 and 0.97 in 2020. The VI-integrated RF was the most effective classifier for LULC, particularly for separating mangroves from homestead vegetation. The changes for 32 years showed that the dense mangrove occupied 42 % of surveyed area in 1988 but declined ca 622 km2 in 2020, whereas sparse mangrove and aquaculture increased by 487 km2 and 464 km2, respectively, out of the total area of 8,360 km2. The changes in LULC classes were mostly from dense mangroves to sparse mangroves, sparse mangroves to dense mangroves and from cropland to bare land and aquaculture. Inaccessible mangrove degradation should result from natural disturbances, i.e., tropical cyclones, while areas near forest boundaries were distorted by anthropogenic disturbances such as aquaculture development. The restoration of habitat quality, mangrove afforestation and sustainable aquaculture practices were effective indicators for improving the mangrove ecosystems. Since natural and anthropogenic disturbances induce substantial loss of mangrove vegetation, the VI-integrated RF classifier should be applied for monitoring LULC and for developing the sustainable management strategies.",mangrove forests,Q1,Elsevier (Ecological Informatics),journal,"Sentinel-2, Landsat",Mangrove; Disturbances; Satellite imagery; Vegetation indices; Random forest; Land use and land cover (LULC) change,MANGROVE FOREST; TIME-SERIES; SUNDARBANS; COVER; INDEX; LAND; CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; BANGLADESH; DENSITY,elimine,

Though highly adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions, increasing disturbances from climate change and human activities have caused significant losses. With increasing environmental uncertainties, adaptive management is necessary to monitor and evaluate changes, and to understand drivers of mangrove decline. Effective management requires access to accurate, current, and multitemporal data on mangrove cover, but such data is often lacking or inaccessible to managers. We present mangrove cover maps for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the British Virgin Islands for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. We used the Random Forest machine learning technique in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) and created mangrove vegetation maps at 10 m resolution, with classification accuracies greater than 85%. We host and present the maps in an easy-to-use GEE decision support tool (DST) for managers and policy makers that allows for evaluation of change over time. We also provide a mapping workflow fully implemented in GEE that allows for the production of subsequent maps with minimal technical expertise required. The DST and mapping workflow can help users to detect impacts of disturbances on mangrove vegetation and to monitor progress of conservation interventions such as rehabilitation or legal protection. Furthermore, our mapping approach differentiates between intact and degraded mangrove vegetation, and the increased spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 MSI imagery allowed us to capture mangrove patches that had not been previously mapped by studies using coarser resolution imagery.

High-quality analyses of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics play a critical role in addressing these challenges. This study introduces a novel high-spatial resolution satellite-based approach to identify sub-seasonal LULC dynamics in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), employing a three-year (2021-2023) Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data time series. The primary obstacle is discerning detailed vegetation dynamics, particularly the seasonality of rice crops, answered through quantile mapping, harmonic regression with Fourier transform, and phenological metrics as inputs to a random forest machine learning classifier. Due to the substantial data volume, Google's cloud computing platform Earth Engine was utilized for the analysis. Furthermore, the study evaluated the relative significance of various input features. The overall accuracy of the classification is 82.6% with a kappa statistic of 0.81, determined using comprehensive reference data collected in Vietnam. While the purely pixel-based approach has limitations, it proves to be a viable method for high-spatial resolution satellite image time series classification of the MRD.",mangrove forests,Q1,MDPI (Remote Sensing),journal,"Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2",land use dynamics; Mekong River Delta; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1; Google Earth Engine; time series; Fourier transform; quantile mapping; rice seasonalities,RICE CROPPING SYSTEMS; HA TIEN PLAIN; TIME-SERIES; MANGROVE FOREST; TREE-COVER; NDVI DATA; TRA-VINH; AREAS; FIELDS; INDEX,elimine,

The achievement of this objective is supported by the use of open-source technologies such as MapStore, GeoServer and Django, as well as Google Earth Engine, which combine to offer a robust and technologically independent solution to the problem. In this context, it was decided to adopt an action model aimed at automating the workflow steps related to data preprocessing, downloading, and publishing. A visualizer with web output (Geospatial System for Monitoring Mangrove Ecosystems or SIGMEM) is developed for the first time, evaluating changes in an area of central Cuba from different vegetation indices.

Thus, understanding their spatial structure and distribution of plant diversity is central to devising effective conservation and management interventions. Nevertheless, studies mapping spatial structure and plant diversity in these communities remain scarce, as the existing ones have been limited to horizontal structure and field-based diversity. This study mapped plant taxonomic diversity and spatial structure of mangrove communities in a protected area in eastern Africa by employing Sentinel-2B satellite imagery. Supervised classification techniques were used to map mangrove patches using the random forest algorithm. The BiodivMapR R package was used to map the plant diversity. Landscape metrics were employed to map the spatial structure, specifically the configuration, distribution, and structural connectivity of mangrove patches. A total of 1773 mangrove patches were recorded, with a mean fractal dimension index and aggregation index of 1.75 and 96.80%, respectively. Patches with high connectivity importance were concentrated in the central parts of the study area. The estimated diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index) ranged from 0 to 1.91, with a mean of 0.54. There was a significant positive correlation between the diversity estimated by satellite images and observed in the field, with R2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 0.0729. Although the mangroves are still in good conservation status, improving conservation efforts is needed to ease the edge effect and increase patch quality and connectivity.

Nevertheless, the disturbance levels in mangrove habitats and seasonal changes have affected phytoplankton abundance, structure, and distribution. Accordingly, the correlation between mangrove age with phytoplankton abundance has been determined in order to find the relationship between these two parameters. More interestingly, the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and river zoning is also assessed considering that high tide would have an effect on the abundance of phytoplankton due to mixing between seawater and freshwater which is considered as contributor to the growth of plankton. The results indicate that the population and compactness of phytoplankton appear higher at the younger mangrove area compared to mature area. This condition is due to the shading produced by the canopy at older mangrove sites, which reduces light availability in the creeks and suppresses phytoplankton growth. The results also discovered that the lowest abundance of phytoplankton is located at upstream of young mangrove areas, while the highest abundance of phytoplankton is located at downstream due to having been carried away by the current heading towards the ocean. This verifies that mangrove age affects the abundance of phytoplankton based on different river zonings.

Other lands in addition, the backscatter image was also included separately in the MLC algorithm for land cover classification. The obtained statistical results showed that when the texture with different windows is placed in the input of the ML algorithm, it has a kappa coefficient value of 0.52, and when the input is a single backscattered image, it has a higher kappa coefficient value of about 0.83. In general, the results show that the map prepared by the only backscattered image performs better and similar to the optical image used.
